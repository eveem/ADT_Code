````
make TARGET="/*FILE'S NAME YOU WANT TO RUN*/"
````

- stack.cpp (cal) - use pointer and array to control stack
- towerOfHanoi.c (Plan) - use simple recursion to implement tower of hanoi problem
- fac-with-dynamic-recur-tailcall.c (Plan) - implement factorial calculate in 3 algorithm
- toPostfix.cpp (Plan) - change infix to postfix using  STL stack
- toPrefix.cpp (Plan) - change infix to prefix using STL stack

* STL	= standard template library
		= cpp library with simple ADT and algorithm
